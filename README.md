# TabardAlert #

## Introduction ##

* TabardAlert is a World of Warcraft (MMORPG) addon.
* It has received around 700 downloads.
* It was created to solve a specific problem my friends and I were having while playing the game.
    * This is a handy little addon that ensures you don't waste reputation in a dungeon. Whenever you kill a mob in a dungeon, it checks the tabard you are wearing. If you are already exalted with them, it will alert you that you are wasting potential rep.
    * I came up with this idea because I have lots of alts and I like to do a lot of dungeons. I was always forgetting to swap tabards when I hit exalted, and I wanted some way to remind myself.
* It was also a way to explore WoW's API and get some experience with Lua.
* It is now out-of-date. It was created during the Wrath of the Lich King expansion at the time I was playing the game.
